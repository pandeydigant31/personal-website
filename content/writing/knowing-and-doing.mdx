Wang Yangming spent the early 16th century arguing with the Chinese philosophical establishment about a seemingly simple idea: that knowledge and action are not separate things. You do not first learn and then apply. The learning IS the doing. If you claim to know something but do not act on it, you do not actually know it.

Five hundred years later, this remains the most useful mental model I have found for building products in physical-world AI.

The standard product management playbook separates research from execution. You do discovery, then you build. You analyze, then you ship. This works tolerably well for software products where the cost of being wrong is a bad sprint. It breaks down completely when you are deploying AI systems into hydrogen plants, government ministries, or robotic fulfillment centers.

In these environments, you cannot fully understand the problem until you have shipped something. The constraints are not discoverable through interviews and surveys alone. They reveal themselves when your system meets physical reality. The sensor that drifts. The operator who ignores your alert because it triggered a false positive last week. The policy requirement that nobody mentioned because everyone assumed you knew.

Yangming would recognize this pattern. Knowledge that has not been tested against reality is not yet knowledge. It is speculation with good formatting.

This does not mean shipping recklessly. It means building evaluation frameworks before building features. It means designing systems that teach you something when they fail. It means treating every deployment as a research instrument, not just a delivery.

The best product managers I have worked with operate this way instinctively. They do not wait for complete information because they understand that completeness is an illusion. They ship small, learn concretely, and let the environment teach them what no amount of upfront analysis could.

To know and not to do is not yet to know. Build the thing. Ship it into the hard environment. Let reality educate you. That is the only kind of knowledge that counts.
