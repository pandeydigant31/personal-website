summary: "The best product decisions I have made came from embracing constraints rather than trying to engineer around them."

There is a specific moment in every product role I have held where the constraint became the strategy. Not the obstacle to the strategy. The strategy itself.

At the Prime Minister's Office, the constraint was that our users, Cabinet Ministers, had approximately 90 seconds per dashboard screen. We could not educate them. We could not add tooltips. We could not send them training materials. Ninety seconds. That constraint forced us to build the most focused analytics product I have ever worked on. One question per screen. One insight per visualization. Zero ambiguity. The product was better because of the constraint, not despite it.

At Amazon, the constraint was that our computer vision system operated alongside human workers in a physical space. We could not deploy a system that behaved unpredictably, even if the unpredictability was in the direction of being "too good." Operators needed to build mental models of what the system would and would not do. Predictability was more valuable than peak performance. That constraint led us to the graduated autonomy model: high confidence automated, medium confidence human-reviewed, low confidence fully manual. It was the right architecture, and we would not have found it without the constraint.

At PlanetIQ, the constraint was data latency. Our satellite observations were worthless if they arrived after the forecast cycle closed. Forty-five minutes from satellite measurement to customer delivery. That constraint reshaped our entire processing pipeline and became our primary competitive differentiator.

I have started to believe that constraints are not things you overcome in good product work. They are things you listen to. A constraint is the environment telling you something about what the product needs to be. Ignoring it, or engineering around it, usually produces a product that is technically sophisticated but practically irrelevant.

The impulse to remove constraints is strong, especially in AI where the technology feels like it should be able to overcome any limitation. But the constraint is usually there for a reason. Physics, human cognition, institutional trust, safety requirements. These are not bugs in your deployment environment. They are features of reality.

The best product managers I know have a specific skill: they can look at a constraint and see a product decision. Not "how do we work around this?" but "what does this tell us about what we should build?"

Start with the constraint. Not the model, not the feature list, not the roadmap. The constraint. Everything else follows.
